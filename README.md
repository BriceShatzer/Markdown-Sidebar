# Markdown-Sidebar
Generates a structured index of page links in a _sidebar include for [gollum](https://github.com/gollum/gollum).

Running `python make_sidebar.py` from within the root directory of the wiki content will create a _Sidebar.md file. Similar to page changes,the updated _Sidebar.md file must be committed before it will be able to be rendered.
